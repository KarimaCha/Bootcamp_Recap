    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So, have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test things by trying them out; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "## Data Structures Continued\n",
    "\n",
    "Up till now you have learned about some very useful data structures in Python: numeric types, strings, and lists. However, the fun doesn't stop there! Today we are going to talk about some other data structures that will allow us to solve very different problems from those that we have been solving so far.\n",

    "### Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that will come up as an important distinction in the structures we learn about today is the concept of mutability. **Mutability** refers to the capability of an object to be changed after it has been instantiated. With lists, we can change the contents at any arbitrary index and even grow the list dynamically..."

    "Mutability is nice, but there are times when you won't want your data structure to be mutable. For example, if you're allowing a user of your program to have access to a data structure, one way to ensure that they won't mess with it (sometimes users do this out of malice, and we want to try and prevent it) is to make the structure **immutable**. There are many more reasons why immutability is a desired trait, and we will discuss plenty more of them throughout the rest of the course.\n",

What's really going on under the hood when you assign a value to a variable is that Python puts that value or data structure in memory, and then simply associates the variable name with that value or data structure. Changing a variable, then, simply amounts to associating that name with a different thing in memory.\n",

This works because Python, upon accessing the contents of `t` at index 1, will find a list. It will then immediately call the `append()` method on that structure.

    "#### Mutability of Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, a question that could be on your mind is whether or not dictionaries are mutable? Well, first, great question. And, second, yes, yes they are! Before we talk about how to mutate them, let's describe dictionaries in the language that we used for lists and tuples. A dictionary is defined as an **unordered** collection of key-value pairs that requires **unique keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, let's recall how we mutated a **list**. To change an element at an existing index, we just indexed into the list and did assignment. To make them bigger, we used the `append()` method. This method of mutation made a lot of sense, considering that lists are ordered. In the unordered paradigm where dictionaries live, to change/add a key-value pair, all you have to do is index into it with the existing/new key and assign a value to it. Notice that assignment works just as before, with the `=`. Let's take a look."

    "#### Caveat to Dictionary Keys, More on Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned that dictionaries make it easy to store key-value relationships in a single data structure that is designed for easy value retrieval. So, what are the restrictions on things you can put in a dictionary? As for the values, like in lists, there are none! But in terms of the keys those values are associated with, that's a different story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys in dictionaries **must** be an immutable type, and if that type is a container, then the container cannot contain any mutable types. Why is this the case? The answer lies in the way that dictionaries store values and associate them with a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python dictionaries are an implementation of what's known as a *hash map* or *hash table* ([here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) the wikipedia page for them if you want to learn more). This computer science idea is basically a function that relates any input, in our case the keys, to a location in memory. Thus, retrieval of a value from a dictionary is entirely dependent on the key. The consequence of this is that, if we were to use a mutable type as the key for a dictionary and later change what that key looked like by mutating it, the dictionary wouldn't be able to find the value it was supposed to associate with that key (since the key has now changed). Let's take a gander at what this type of incorrect usage would look like, but know, the code below will **not** run."

    "#### Why Do We Need Sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, that's cool, but when would I use a set? That's a great question! The most apparent answer is for times when you need to perform set operations, like checking what elements two lists have in common. Take the set of them both and find the intersection of those sets. The most obvious use case is to find the unique items in an iterable. There's also another amazing place where we'll want to use sets that might not be so apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, when discussing dictionaries above, we talked about how checking if an item is in a list requires us to check every item in the list? This can be computationally expensive and generally we want to avoid it. What do we do instead, then?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a set! The reason why lies in the fact that sets in Python are built very similarly to dictionaries. There's an underlying hash table that allows elements to be stored, and, more importantly, queried for membership within a set (*Note, this means that the elements of a set have to be immutable*). This operation happens much faster with sets than with lists ([here's](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) some coverage on how quickly some Python methods run). Let's take a look at this in action, and simultaneously learn about how to time things in IPython."
