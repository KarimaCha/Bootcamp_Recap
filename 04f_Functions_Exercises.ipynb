    "For this assignment you'll be working through solving more problems, but this time by building functions from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For each problem, you should build a function into your solution. We will build each function into it's own file, and then call it with some arguments right after you define it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, pretend all of the following is the solution to one of the problems, written in a function first and then called (for testing purposes) below. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def my_func(param1, param2, param3): \n",
    "    # Function code to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "print my_func(param11, param21, param31)\n",
    "print my_func(param12, param22, param32)\n",
    "print my_func(param13, param23, param33)\n",
    "print my_func(param14, param24, param34)\n",
    "print my_func(param15, param25, param35)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note above that `my_func` is called five times after it's definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of each call is printed so running the script from the command line will print the tests. These tests should check that `my_func` works correctly with different sets of arguments. You should aim to test your functions at least 5 times tonight after you write them. It's good to try to think of tests that your function might not solve correctly (we call these **edge cases**). Not only does thinking like this help you solve the problem, but it also gives you more faith in your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can name each of the scripts you store your solutions and tests in, but know that its bad practice to start the names of scripts with numbers for reasons that we will see in future classes.\n",

    "7. Write a function that takes in a list of strings, as well as an inputted substring (i.e. another string), and returns a list of the indices of the strings that contain that inputted substring.

    "1. Let's build a calculator for figuring out how much I owe in taxes (and by calculator, I mean function). Write a function that takes in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two values, as well as an income to compute the taxes on (so your function should accept two arguments). For the tuple list, the first value of a tuple will be an income upper bound, and the second will be a tax rate for all income up to the given income bound. You need to build a calculator that will calculate the tax for all income up to each income bound (if it goes up that high) for the given tax rate. You can assume that the list of tuples will be sorted by the income bound (e.g. the first value in the tuple), such that the lowest income bound will be first, and the highest last (see below for an example).  \n",
    "\n",
    " As an example, let's say my tax info is `[(50000, 0.08), (100000, 0.10), (150000, 0.15)]`. This means that the first 50k of income is taxed at 8%, the second 50k at 10%, and the rest at 15% (note here that any income that is left past the highest upper bound given is taxed at the rate for that highest upper bound). So, if the inputted income was 70k, then my taxes would be 50 * 0.08 + 20 * 0.10 = 6k. You should write your function to be generalized and accept any kind of list of tuples and any inputted income (so it'll accept two arguments).  \n",
