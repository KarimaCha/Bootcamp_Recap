    "#### Calling Functions with Positional Versus Keyword Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, when we call a function and pass arguments to it we have seen Python assign those arguments to the correct parameters (for example, 5 to `n` and 2 to `divisor`, above). But how exactly does this happen - how does Python know that when we call `get_multiples(5, 2)`, 5 should get assigned to `n` and 2 should get assigned to `divisor`?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that, by default, Python simply matches up the position of the arguments that are passed in with the position of the parameters that are given in the function definition. In our `get_multiples(5, 2)` call, it takes the first argument passed, `5`, and assigns that to the first parameter in the function definition, `n`. Similarly, it takes the second argument passed, `2`, and assigns it to the second parameter in the function definition, `divisor`. This method of passing arguments is **by position**, and the arguments `5` and `2` in this example are considered to be **positional arguments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed from the title of this section, there is another method of passing arguments, and that is **by keyword**. The way this works is that instead of passing just the values in the function call, we call the values with the parameter name that they correspond to followed by an equals sign. Building off of our example above, using **keyword arguments** would mean our function call would look like this: `get_multiples(n=5, divisor=2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, got it! But, there are one or two more things that we need to cover with regards to this topic. In the above examples, we used either **all** positional arguments or **all** keyword arguments. However, there is the possibility that we can use a mixture of positional and keyword arguments if we'd like. The only caveat is that we have to pass all positional arguments **before** passing any keyword arguments. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: def get_multiples(n=5, divisor=2):\n",
    "   ...:     multiples_lst = []\n",
    "   ...:     for element in range(n):\n",
    "   ...:         if element % divisor == 0:\n",
    "   ...:             multiples_lst.append(element)\n",
    "   ...:     return multiples_lst\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: get_multiples(5, 2) # All arguments passed by position.\n",
    "Out[2]: [0, 2, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: get_multiples(n=5, divisor=2) # All arguments passed by keyword.\n",
    "Out[3]: [0, 2, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: get_multiples(10, divisor=3) # Okay mix of positional and keyword arguments.\n",
    "Out[4]: [0, 3, 6, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [5]: get_multiples(n=10, 3) # Not okay mix of positional and keyword arguments.\n",
    "File \"<ipython-input-15-e4167d3728c9>\", line 1\n",
    "    get_multiples(n=10, 3)\n",
    "SyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg\n",

    "### Variable Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable scope is a topic in and of itself, but up until now we haven't really had a good reason to discuss it. **Variable scope** is going to define the part (or block) of your program in which a variable is visible. We typically refer to one of two scopes for variables - **global** scope and **local** scope. A variable with **global** scope is visible everywhere. It can be used anywhere in your script, including any of the functions you have written (it can even be used inside of a function written inside of a function). A variable with **local** scope, on the other hand, is only visible in the scope in which it is enclosed (typically a function).\n",
    "\n",
    "When referencing a variable, Python will search the following scopes (in order) to resolve the reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The current function's scope.\n",
    "2. Any enclosing scopes (like other containing functions).\n",
    "3. The scope of the module (i.e. script) that contains the code (often referred to as the **global** scope).\n",
    "4. The built-in scope (contains the built-in functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is kind of a confusing concept to grasp, so let's look at a concrete example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: my_global_var = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: def my_test_func():\n",
    "   ...:     print \"My global variable:\",  my_global_var # Accessible and will print.\n",
    "   ...:     my_local_var = 10 # Only accessible in my_test_func.\n",
    "   ...:     print \"My local variable:\", my_local_var  \n",
    "   ...:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: my_global_var # Remember it's accessible anywhere.\n",
    "Out[3]: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: my_test_func()\n",
    "My global variable: 5\n",
    "My local variable: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "In [5]: print my_local_var\n",
    "NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "<ipython-input-4-b0b2b2a41781> in <module>()\n",
    "    > 1 print my_local_var\n",
    "\n",
    "NameError: name 'my_local_var' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that `my_global_var` is accessible anywhere - both inside and outside of our function. This is because it is in the **global scope**. `my_local_var`, on the other hand, was defined within `my_test_func`. As a result, it is enclosed within the scope of `my_test_func`, and not accessible outside of it.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### List and Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "The last topic we'll cover today is a different way to construct lists and dictionaries. Up to now, every time that we have built up a list or dictionary, we began by initializing it. We then took advantage of their mutability inherent to build them up one element or key-value pair at a time. However, there is a more succinct way to accomplish the vast majority of your list and dictionary construction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the specifics about how this new tool (list comprehensions) works, let's look at an example question where we build a list.  We can then show how to perform the same task with our new tool and learn how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine that we have the list `[1, 5, 9, 33]` stored in the variable `my_list`. Now, let's assume that we want to make a new list of the squares of all the values in `my_list` and call it `my_squares`. With the tools we have covered so far, you might write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_squares = []\n",
    "for num in my_list:\n",
    "    my_squares.append(num ** 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, `my_squares` will hold the list `[1, 25, 81, 1089]`. To get this, we were simply specifying a bunch of stuff that we wanted to add on to the end of the `my_squares` list, with a starting point at `my_list`. So, from a high level, we can write the framework of creating a list in code as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_were_building = []\n",
    "for thing in iterable:\n",
    "    list_were_building.append(transform(thing))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this structure in mind, we can use the following syntax to perform the same task of building up a list in a single line! Check it out, along with how it would look for the construction of `my_squares`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_were_building = [transform(thing) for thing in iterable]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This last line of code does the exact same thing as the three lines above! In this line, the thing that we would pass to the `append()` method, `transform(thing)`, comes at the beginning of the statement in the `[]`.  These `[]` allow for the final product to be defined as a list. Then, the `for` loop statement that we had written is at the end. This is the basic idea behind the [list comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can build our `my_squares` list using a list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_squares = [num ** 2 for num in my_list]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait! There's more! Remember in all the examples where we were getting evens, we had a condition to decide when to append a value to a list? We can also use conditions to determine what \"transformed things\" get added in a list comprehension! Let's look at the evens list builder to hammer this home.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Old way of constructing list of evens\n",
    "evens = []\n",
    "for num in range(10):\n",
    "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        evens.append(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Old way at high level\n",
    "list_were_building = []\n",
    "for thing in iterable:\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        list_were_building.append(transform(thing))\n",
    "\n",
    "# List comprehension way of constructing list of evens\n",
    "evens = [num for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# List comprehension way at high level\n",
    "list_were_building = [transform(thing) for thing in iterable if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The way `transform()` was called in the above examples, as though it were a function, is an option when writing list comps. For example, the `my_squares` example could be accomplished in the same way with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(num):\n",
    "    return num ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "my_squares = [square(num) for num in my_list]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem silly, since we could just write `num ** 2` directly in the list comp as we did above. However, this calling of a function in the list comp becomes a powerful idea when you want to transform the values being iterated over in a complex way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as list comprehensions are a more succinct way of constructing a list, we have the same ability for dictionaries. Dictionary comprehensions operate in the same way as their list counterparts, except for one fundamental difference. Recall that dictionaries have no `append()` method, and that a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary with the syntax: `my_dict[new_key] = new_value`. In this way, it makes sense that we need syntax to pass both the key and value to the dictionary comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Python gives a simple way to pass a key and value pair, and it is already very familiar to you! You just separate the key and value that you want to enter into the dictionary with a colon, like we did when we were hardcoding the contents in the `{}` dictionary constructor, i.e. `my_dict = {1: 1, 2: 4}`. Let's look at an example where we make a dictionary with the keys as the numbers 1 - 5, and the values as the squares of the keys. We'll do this with both the old way of constructing a dictionary, and then with a dictionary comprehension so that we can see the similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: squares_dict = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: for num in range(1, 6):\n",
    "   ...:     squares_dict[num] = num ** 2\n",
    "   ...:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: squares_dict\n",
    "Out[3]: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: squares_dict = {num: num ** 2 for num in range(1, 6)}\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: squares_dict\n",
    "Out[4]: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that in both cases, we're going through the numbers 1 - 5 with `range(1, 6)` and those `num`s are being assigned as keys. The values assigned to those keys are the squares of the keys, assigned with `squares_dict[num] = num ** 2` and `num: num ** 2`, respectively. Just as with list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions read as the first thing being the `key: value` pair being added to the dictionary. Then, left to right (top down in the old way), we have what the loop definition would look like. And, just as with list comps, we can add a condition to filter what gets put into the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that we want a dictionary with a random integer between 1 and 10, associated with each of the values in the list of words: `['cow', 'chicken', 'horse', 'moose']`. Let's look at how we'd do that with a dictionary comprehension. (We're importing from the Python library `random` to get our random integers. We'll talk more about importing later in the course.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: from random import randint\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: animals_list = ['cow', 'chicken', 'horse', 'moose']\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: animals_dict = {animal: randint(1, 10) for animal in animals_list}\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: animals_dict\n",
    "Out[4]: {'chicken': 2, 'cow': 10, 'horse': 9, 'moose': 8}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can actually use the syntax from the list comprehensions to construct a tuple in what seems like a dynamic way. Take the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: my_tuple = tuple(num for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: my_tuple\n",
    "Out[2]: (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All we are doing here is passing `num for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0` to the tuple constructor, `()`. Since the tuple constructor takes any iterable, which that statement produces, it makes a tuple out of the contents. Note that it would be impossible to make a tuple with statements like this the \"old way\", since tuples don't support appending or mutation of any kind!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, in addition to their readability, comprehensions of all types are considered the most Pythonic way of constructing new data structures.\n"
