If we want an entire column, then we're going to place the **column name** in brackets (and multiple column names in a list inside those brackets). We can also sometimes access a column via dot notation on the dataframe, which we'll show in a second. If we want an entire row, then we have to place **both** a **beginning and ending index** inside the brackets (it won't work to just place a single index in the brackets). "

To fill nulls, we use the `.fillna()` method on the DataFrame, and to drop nulls, we call the `.dropna()` method on the DataFrame. In terms of the `.fillna()` function, we can give it a default value to fill in, or a number of other methods to fill it in (padding, back filling, foward filling). You can read about dealing with missing data in the docs [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#cleaning-filling-missing-data). We're not going to go into too much depth here, but want you to know that this functionality exists. "

    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that in a couple of places, when we asked for certain rows/columns of the data, we got back a 1-D array that had an index attached. These are examples of what Pandas calls `Series`. In the documentation for [Pandas Series](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/dsintro.html#series), you can get an idea of what they can do. For the most part, we can kind of treat them like a mini DataFrame, as they have a lot of the same methods. However, there are some slight differences. Since we work with DataFrame's the majority of the time, we're not going to go into any real depth on Series. \n",

    "## A quick look at vizualization in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous libraries available in Python for creating vizualizations. Often times, we will probably be using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and/or [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) for anything that is general purpose, and then other libraries if we need something more specialized ([Plotly](https://plot.ly/) for dashboards, for example). All of these libraries allow us to build great looking visualizations that can be used in a production setting. If we want something quick and dirty to visualize our data very easily, there is also some plotting functionality built into Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html), we can see that the plotting available with Pandas will be called via the `plot()` method on a DataFrame object. From there, we'll pass in a bunch of potential arguments to the `plot()` method to specify exactly how to build the plot. The most important of those arguments is the `kind` keyword argument, which tells the `plot()` method what kind of visualization we would like (bar plot, histogram, scatter plot, etc.). Tonight we'll look at one or two examples - since most of the time we'll be doing your visualization in Matplotlib or Seaborn, we'll just give you a taste of what Pandas can do so that you know it's there. We'll look at Seaborn and Matplotlib in a little bit more depth in a later class. "
